Save Telegram Chat History
--------------------------

###Why this extension?
Perhaps, many of us use and like Telegram messenger for conversations with friends. However, we were a bit disappointed by the absence of any sort of easy-accessible "Save Conversation" feature in the messenger. Therefore, we've written a Chrome extension for it! 

###How It Works
- Install the Chrome extension "Save Telegram Chat History". You should now see a new icon in the browser.
- Visit https://web.telegram.org.
- Select a peer you want to get history from. ~~Scroll up for the complete history.~~ 
- Click on the icon "Save Telegram Chat History".
- In the popup window click "Load more history" to fetch more messages, then select all text (Ctrl+A) and copy it (Ctrl+C).
- Paste the text into a text editor (Ctrl+V) and save to a local file.
- Congratulations! You are done.


###Features
* Shows your history with a Telegram peer as text.
* Works even for DELETED accounts.
* Autoscroll history (since 1.2.0).
* You can configure the output format (since 1.3.0).

###Requirements
* Chrome browser (48+), not tested on older versions.
* ~~So far, only the English version of the Telegram web interface has been tested.~~ Supported languages of web interface are English, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Portuguese.
